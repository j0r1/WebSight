WebSight
========

With WebSight you can replace an image on a web site with a picture
taken by your webcam. This only changes the way the web page looks on
_your_ computer, and only until you reload the page. 

WebSight is a [bookmarklet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet), to
use it:

 1. Drag the bookmarklet link below to the bookmarks bar of your browser.
 2. Go to some web page.
 3. Click on the WebSight button in your bookmarks bar.
 4. After a few seconds you should see a message telling you to press 'OK'
    and click on an image that you want to replace. Press OK.
 5. Click on an image.
 6. After allowing your webcam to take pictures, you'll see the webcam
    video where first the selected image was.
 7. Press 'OK' again in the message box when you're done.
 8. That's it!
